NotAirBnb is a project developed during my time at App Academy, and is aimed at cloning both the UI and  functionality of AirBnB. This application utilizes JS, Node, Express, SQL, Sequelize, SQLite3, React, Redux, and Postgres to create a fully functional frontend and backend. NotAirBnB is currently hosted on Render at the following link and the UI is optimized for a width of 1024px:
